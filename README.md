**The author is not liable for any damage resulting from the use of this software. User might broke his games, steam, OS or even computer. User account might to be banned by Valve. EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU'RE DOING ON YOUR OWN RISK!**

## Restrictions
There are a few known problems with this tool. Some of them will be solved in future, others are not solvable.

SteamForwarder are NOT able to run by design:

* DRM-protected games

SteamForwarder are NOT able to download:

* Everything that steamcmd are not able to download (mostly paid games with protection)

SteamForwarder may encounter problems with any games, except ones built with latest steam api. (The version on Releases page is not built againist latest steam api, it includes api for one of wide spread versions). The **Hard way** might solve the problem but not in all cases. In most complicated case the steam api headers for particular version are required. For pre-2014 steam api it's recomended to use [SteamBrige](https://github.com/sirnuke/steambridge)

## Usage dependences
* steamcmd
* python3
* wine

## Usage

This is common scenario of usage SteamForwarder for users.
Some hints for experts can be found in section below.

* Download redist.tar.bz2 from latest release of SteamForwarder from releases page
* Unpack it to the folder you want
* Open the terminal in the folder SteamForwarder was unpacked
* Type `python3 app_install.py --help` to learn command line options of installer tool.
* Use app\_install.py to install your windows game. E.g. for Paladins it command will be `python3 app_install.py 444090`. The steam appid of the game can be found in url of the game page in steam store site.
* Launch your linux **steam** (don't allow it to update your windows games if they support MacOS either)
* Run installed game via runscript generated. (Its location will be printed after app\_install.py will install the game.)

## Found a bug?
Feel free to post the issue. Don't forget to attach the wine log with `WINEDEBUG=trace+steam_api` environment variable set.
If you're starting the game from the runscript generated by the **app_install.py** the required log can be found in the
runscript folder (it's named **lastrun.log**).

## Compilation dependences
General:
* Wine headers with winegcc

Fedora:
* glibc-devel.i686
* wine-devel.i686

Arch:
* wine

## Compilation
1. Obtain [somewhere](https://partner.steamgames.com/home) latest steam api headers and put them into the **steam** folder. (They cannot be included to this repo due to licensing issues.)
2. Obtain libsteam_api.so from any of your linux games or from the sdk obtained in p.1, then put it to the repo root.
3. Open the terminal in the repo root and type `make`.
4. If something went wrong - go to the **Hard way** section.
5. When compilation will be completed you will see **steam_api.dll.so** in the repo root.

## Usage (for experts)
1. Put your **libsteam_api.so** into LD_LIBRARY_PATH accessable location.
2. Put created **steam_api.dll.so** into WINEDLLPATH accessable location.
3. Once per WINEPREFIX set "*steam_api" as buildin via winecfg
4. Run the **steam**
5. Run your windows game through the wine.

## Hard way
1. Install the [Nim compiler](https://nim-lang.org/download.html) of version 0.15+ (probably, it can be found in your distro repo). PS: Yes, I know, that code generator could be implemented in some popular language like python, but I wanted to write it in Nim just because I like this language and want to make it popular =P
2. Put **steam_api.dll** from your game into repo root.
3. Regenerate code by `make generate-code`.
4. Compile SteamForwarder using `make` command.
